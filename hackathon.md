# 🚀 GitHub Copilot Hackathon Challenge
# https://github.com/Jfhelin/hack

Welcome to the **GitHub Copilot Hackathon**!  
This challenge will guide you through the latest Copilot features — from *Ask* and *Edit* modes to *MCP-powered issues*, *Copilot Coding Agent*, and *AI PR reviews*.  
You’ll work inside your own repository, experimenting freely and discovering how Copilot transforms your workflow.

---

## 🧭 Phase 1 – Setup & Preparation

**Goal:** Get your environment and repository ready for Copilot experimentation.

<details>
<summary>🔹 <b>1️⃣ Find or fork a project</b></summary>

- [ ] Pick a repository you’re comfortable working in — any language works.  
  You can:
  - Use an existing project you maintain.  
  - Fork a public repo (e.g. from [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore)).  

- [ ] Copy the markdown of this issue into your own issue in your working repo so that you can modify it.  

- [ ] Create a **new branch**, e.g. `copilot-hackathon`.  
  Keep all experiments in this branch — do **not** modify your `main`.

> ⚠️ Copilot never commits code without your consent, but keep your hackathon work isolated.
</details>

---

<details>
<summary>🔹 <b>2️⃣ Ensure GitHub Copilot is enabled</b></summary>

- [ ] Make sure the **GitHub Copilot** extension is installed and active in your IDE.  
- [ ] Ensure you also have **Copilot Chat** available (and optionally **Copilot Edits/Agent** features if supported by your IDE).

📘 **Documentation:**
- [Getting started with GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot)
- [Setting up GitHub Copilot in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup)

> 💡 You don’t need three separate installs — Copilot Chat and Edits are included in most IDE integrations.  
> Just verify both completions and chat are visible in your IDE.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔹 <b>3️⃣ Configure the GitHub MCP server</b></summary>

We’ll use **Copilot MCP** to let Copilot Chat access your repo and issues.

- [ ] In your **new branch**, create a folder `.vscode` if it doesn’t exist.  
- [ ] Inside it, create a file named `mcp.json`.  
- [ ] Copy content from 👉 [`.vscode/mcp.json`](https://github.com/Jfhelin/hack/blob/main/.vscode/mcp.json).  
- [ ] Commit the file to your current branch.
- [ ] Observe and click the 'start' link on the top of the definition text in the mcp.json file.

## 💬 Phase 2 – Exploring Copilot Chat Modes

**Goal:** Learn how Copilot helps you explore, understand, and reason about your code.

<details>
<summary>🔹 <b>4️⃣ Explore your code using Ask mode</b></summary>

Pick a file or function you don’t know well and experiment freely with **Copilot Chat**.

Try questions like:
- [ ] “Explain what this function does, step by step.”  
- [ ] “Where is this class used?”  
- [ ] “Could this function be simplified?”  
- [ ] “Generate a test for this logic.”  
- [ ] “Rewrite this using a different algorithm.”  

💡 **Be curious!** Ask follow-ups. Ask *why*. Modify prompts.  
Try *Ask*, *Explain*, *Generate*, and *Edit* modes to see how each behaves.

- [ ] Switch between models (e.g. `GPT-5`, `Claud Sonnet 4.5`, `Claud Haiku 4.5`) and compare reasoning quality.

<details>
<summary>🔹 <b>5️⃣ Generate a <code>copilot_instructions.md</code> file</b></summary>

Copilot can generate **project setup and context notes** automatically — this file helps Copilot understand your project and coding style better.

### 💡 Why we’re doing this
The `copilot_instructions.md` file acts as a **knowledge source** for Copilot.  
It summarizes:
- How the project is structured  
- How to build and run it  
- Key dependencies, conventions, and folders  

When this file exists, Copilot can use it to **reason more effectively** about your codebase — for example, it can:
- Give more accurate answers when you ask questions about the project.  
- Provide better suggestions for refactoring, debugging, and tests.  
- Maintain consistent terminology and architecture decisions in its output.

Think of it as giving Copilot a “project briefing document”.

### 🧭 Steps
- [ ] Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`)  
- [ ] Search for **“Copilot: Generate Project Instructions”**  
- [ ] Follow the prompts to create a new file named `copilot_instructions.md`  

Once it’s created, open the file and read what Copilot generated.  
You can edit and expand this file — Copilot will use any updates in future conversations.

## 🧩 Phase 3 – Working with Issues via MCP

**Goal:** Use Copilot’s MCP connection to explore, understand, and create issues.

<details>
<summary>🔹 <b>6️⃣ Explore and discuss issues (via MCP)</b></summary>

Now that the `github-remote` MCP server is configured:

- [ ] Use Copilot Chat to list or summarize issues in your repo.  
  Examples:
  - “List open issues in this repo.”  
  - “Summarize issue #12.”  
  - “Suggest next steps for this bug.”  
  - “How could we improve code related to this issue?”

📘 [Using GitHub Copilot in Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/chat-with-copilot/chat-in-ide)
</details>

---

<details>
<summary>🔹 <b>7️⃣ Analyze code relevant to an issue</b></summary>

- [ ] Pick an interesting issue.  
- [ ] Ask Copilot to locate where in the code this occurs, or to explain related logic.  

Examples:
> “Show me where this issue might occur in the code.”  
> “Explain how this module works.”  
> “What might cause this behavior?”
</details>

---

<details>
<summary>🔹 <b>8️⃣ Generate a new issue</b></summary>

Once you’ve discussed a potential change, ask Copilot Chat to create a new issue.

- [ ] “Generate a new issue proposing a refactor of this method.”  
- [ ] “File an issue to add input validation.”  

Let Copilot generate the issue content directly.
</details>

---

<details>
<summary>🔹 <b>9️⃣ Assign the new issue to Copilot Coding Agent</b></summary>

You can do this in two ways:

- [ ] In Copilot Chat, say **“Assign this issue to the Copilot Coding Agent.”**  
- [ ] **Or** on **GitHub.com** → open the issue → click **Assignees** → select **@copilot**.

Observe how the Coding Agent interprets and plans the task.

</details>

## 🧮 Phase 4 – Reviewing and Reflection

**Goal:** Use Copilot to review and reason about existing work.

<details>
<summary>🔹 <b>🔟 Request a Copilot code review (on GitHub.com)</b></summary>

- [ ] Go to your repository on **GitHub.com**.  
- [ ] Find an existing Pull Request (in your org’s main project or your own branch).  
- [ ] Assign **@copilot** as a reviewer.  

Copilot will analyze the diff and comment directly on the PR.

> ⚠️ This action **updates the PR** with Copilot’s review comments.  
> 💡 *Alternative:* If you prefer, create a **duplicate PR** (from your hackathon branch) and assign Copilot there — this preserves the original untouched.
